	**Dear fellow researchers!**

    Thank you very much for taking part in our comic user study!

    	We would like to evaluate the potential of comics for describing scientific projects and user interfaces by introducing you to the DYLEN project. No worries, you will learn more about DYLEN in the next step.

    	After answering the introductory questions below and clicking on the link at the bottom of this page, you will be redirected to either an article or a comic strip explaining details about DYLEN, including background information and its user interface. You will then be confronted with a quiz and a number of practical tasks to complete using the DYLEN tool. Please answer them as good as you can, feel free to re-read sections and play around in the application.

    	Your interactions within this page as well as the article/comic will be tracked using a software called [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) which we are using to analyse user flows within the application. The collected data includes your approximate location, timestamps, scroll and click behaviour on this page as well as your answers to the quizzes. We do not collect any names or affiliations nor actions you perform in other tabs or browser windows. You may skip the experiment at any time by simply closing this tab.

    		Once again, thank you very much for supporting our research! If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact us!
